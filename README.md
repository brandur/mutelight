# mutelight [![Build Status](https://github.com/brandur/mutelight/workflows/mutelight%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brandur/mutelight/actions)

The source for my ancient blog Mutelight, reclaimed from [a previous dynamic project](https://github.com/brandur/mutelight-v2), and remade into a static site powered by [Modulir](https://github.com/brandur/modulir). Online at [mutelight.org](https://mutelight.org).
